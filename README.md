# NoRM
Activation induced heterogeneity: Single cells in a macrophage population respond differently to stimulus. Upon secondary stimuli some of these cells can become non-responsive.
This non-responsiveness can be permanent (at least over an observed period of time) or even reversible as seen by delayed kinetics. This code models to appearance and disappearance 
of these proposed states (Dey et al, unpublished) by using a Doob-Gillespie algorithm. This code traces the time-evolution of these states and predicts transition rates that may
be closest to predicting experimental data. These parameters are referred to as NoRM parameters.
